    The group’s first venture outside the US finally arrived in London in August 2012. It offers a unique blend of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine, culture and music. On the 38th and 39th floors of Moorgate’s Heron Tower, two outdoor terraces look out over the City. It’s open for lunch and dinner, or simply enjoy the view with cocktails from the bar and lounge.

Non est enim vitium in oratione solum, sed etiam in moribus. Sed quid attinet de rebus tam apertis plura requirere?
