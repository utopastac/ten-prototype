    Ever since John Profumo first laid eyes on Christine Keeler as she basked in Cliveden’s pool, it’s been clear that this Berkshire boutique hotel was destined to be a Ten Group retreat of choice. As well as being a celebrated haunt for politicos and literati, this majestic neoclassical manor, with its air of faded grandeur, is the proud birthplace of the £100 club sandwich – worth every penny, we’re relieved to add.

    ### Ameneties

    - Basking Shark
    - Pickled onions at the bar

    Si enim ad populum me vocas, eum. Naturales divitias dixit parabiles esse, quod parvo esset natura contenta. Re mihi non aeque satisfacit, et quidem locis pluribus. Res enim fortasse verae, certe graves, non ita tractantur, ut debent, sed aliquanto minutius. In qua quid est boni praeter summam voluptatem, et eam sempiternam? Non est enim vitium in oratione solum, sed etiam in moribus. Sed quid attinet de rebus tam apertis plura requirere?
